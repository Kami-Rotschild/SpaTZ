Its main purpose is to check for
- component integrity
- voice activation
- battery protection

This is achieved by different sensors and techniques, which log its results on an SD-Card.
One of its safety measures, where the device deactivates automatically, is when the SD-Card is removed. 

All measures together provide an excellent listening experience, even at a train station!
